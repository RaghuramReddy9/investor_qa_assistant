Investing is the act of allocating money with the expectation of generating income or profit over time.

Common investment instruments include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Risk and return are closely related in investing. Higher potential returns usually come with higher risk.

Diversification is a strategy that spreads investments across different assets to reduce risk.
